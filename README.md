use the pixel information to build a matrix of 3 variables for the red , green, and blue color in the images 
use  cutoff of 0.5 to specify whether the images are outdoor or not 
perform two models based on logistics regressions analysis and linear discriminant 
compare the sensitivity , the specificity and misclassifications errors for both models
